     PerlModule Apache::OneTimeDownload
 
     <Location /download>
                    PerlHandle Apache:OneTimeDownload
                    SetHandler perl-script
                    PerlSetVar OneTimeDb  /home/sheriff/download_access.db
                    PerlSetVar OneTimeWindow 3600
                    PerlSetVar OneTimeDownloadDirectory /home/sheriff/downloads/
            </Location>

    Example authorize.pl...

            #!/usr/bin/perl
        
            use Apache::OneTimeURL;
        
            my $file = $ARGV[0];
            my $comment = $ARGV[1-];
            my $db = '/opt/secret/access.db'

            print Apache::OneTimeURL::authorize( $db, $comment, $file );

    and then:

     % authorize.pl TopSecret.pdf Given out on IRC...
     2c61de78edd612cf79c0d73a3c7c94fb

    Which might mean:

            http://www.sheriff.com/download/2c61de78edd612cf79c0d73a3c7c94fb

CONFIG
  OneTimeDb
    The location of the DB file where key->file mappings will be kept

  OneTimeWindow
    The amount of time after a download you wish the file to remain before
    it expires. An hour is a good sized window...

  OneTimeDownloadDirectory
    The directory from which you're serving your file downloads - probably
    not one that's accessible from the web...

&authorize
    Adds a key to the db. Accepts these arguments, in this order:

  db name
    Absolute path of the database

  comment
    Plain text comments about the file

  file
    Location of the file - this has the download directory stuck at the
    beginning of it when it comes to download time...

  expires
    Time in seconds until the file expires before anyone has downloaded it.
    Defaults to a week.
